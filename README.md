### Details

The Docker files in the dockerfiles directory build on each other in the following manner:

- `Makefile` the entrance of the packager
- `build` used to store the compiled temporary files generated during the packaging process
- `build-deb.sh & build-rpm.sh` they are mapped to the docker image to perform the compilation action
- `output` directory for packages
